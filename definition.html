            <p>A metaverse is a virtual reality simulation that can be used for various purposes,
                from entertainment and social networking to education and business. It is a 3D virtual
                world created and maintained by users and can be explored and interacted with just 
                like the physical world. It is a hypothetical iteration of the internet as a universal
                and immersive virtual world focused on social connection. 
                <br><br>
                You can think of the metaverse as a cyberspace, or an evolved, three-dimensional 
                internet where logging in isn’t necessary. It may also incorporate elements of 
                virtual and augmented reality.
                <br><br>
                At the moment, the idea of one universally acknowledged metaverse is still 
                speculative — the stuff of science fiction. But that hasn’t stopped some tech 
                giants from building metaverse-like experiences, such as virtual fashion shows, 
                live concerts and workspaces.
                <br><br>
                There is no single way of accessing the metaverse at this point in time. Baggili,
                 a cybersecurity expert, says that there are multiple platforms that offer VR,
                  augmented reality, and extended reality. However, there is no single portal to
                   use these.

            <p>Platforms such as Fortnite, Roblox, decentral, and Sandbox are a few such examples. 
            These worlds can typically be accessed through a VR headset where users can navigate 
            with the help of voice controllers, eye movements, or motion sensing controllers. 
            This creates a feeling of physically being present in the virtual world.  <br><br>
            To access the metaverse in action, we can look at popular multiplayer games such as 
            Fortnite, Rec Room, or Horizon Worlds. The wider and newer applications of the metaverse
             that tech companies are experimenting with are building virtual stadiums to watch a 
            football game, hosting concerts, or virtual shopping. <br><br>
            Although the metaverse has been branded to be a more expansive and exaggerated 
            version of virtual reality, the gaming world has already adopted its rudimentary 
            form. For example, the online game Fortnite. In this game, users have a personal 
            avatar that is used to interact with other such players, earn virtual currency, 
            change outfits, and more. <br>
